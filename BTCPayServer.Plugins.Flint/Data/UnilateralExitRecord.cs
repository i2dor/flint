/// Durable record of one unilateral-exit attempt: the quote it was built from, the funding UTXOs it consumed,

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>This row is not a log. It is the only copy of the exit.</b> A cooperative exit (see
/// <see cref="SweepRecord"/>) is resolvable after a crash because the SDK holds it: the idempotency key becomes
/// a <c>Payment.id</c> and <c>GetPayment</c> answers definitively. A unilateral exit has no such backstop — the
/// SDK builds and signs the tree, hands the transactions back, and <em>never broadcasts</em>. Until every one of
/// them is confirmed, the signed hex in <see cref="TransactionsJson"/> is the merchant's claim on their own
/// money, and losing it means re-quoting and re-funding from scratch.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The row is written at quote time, before any funding exists, because the funding step is the part that takes
/// human time. An exit is quoted, then the operator sends sats to <see cref="FundingAddress"/> — possibly hours
/// later, possibly after a restart — and only then is it built. The leaf set is pinned across that gap by
/// <see cref="LeafIdsJson"/>: the build re-quotes with <c>ExitLeafSelection.Specific</c> naming exactly the
/// leaves the operator was shown a price for, so the second quote cannot silently become a different exit than
/// the one they funded.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The three JSON columns are plain <c>text</c> holding the seam DTOs (<c>SparkExitFundingUtxo[]</c>, and the
/// <c>SparkExitTransaction[]</c> with the time its statuses were read) and a bare <c>string[]</c> of leaf ids. Serialisation is deliberately the
/// caller's job rather than this entity's: the data layer stays free of the seam types, so nothing here has to
/// change when the SDK's exit shapes move under the next version bump. Exactly one caller does it — the exit
/// service — so the write format has a single owner and no other layer reads the blobs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>An instance may be a partial row.</b> <see cref="IUnilateralExitRecordStore.ListTerminalForStoreAsync"/>
/// projects the history list without the three JSON columns, because a five-column table has no business
/// dragging every signed transaction set in a store's past out of the database. Such an instance carries an
/// empty <see cref="LeafIdsJson"/> and null blobs, which is safe to write back only because the store's update
/// coalesces those two blobs rather than assigning them — see
