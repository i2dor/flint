/// <para>
/// Three callers converge here, and they must agree: the SDK event consumer, BTCPay's
/// <c>GetInvoice</c> lookup, and the plugin's own reconciliation task. Sharing the code is what makes
/// "exactly one caller notifies BTCPay" true rather than aspirational — the guarantee lives in
/// <see cref="IInvoiceRecordStore.SettleAsync"/>'s compare-and-set, and every path has to go through it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a reconciliation task exists at all.</b> Settlement cannot rely on the SDK's events: a completed
/// receive has been observed emitting only <c>PaymentPending</c> and never <c>PaymentSucceeded</c>, with the
/// completion visible solely from a later storage read. Nor can it rely on BTCPay re-polling. BTCPay calls
/// <c>GetInvoice</c> once per invoice when the invoice is created or activated, and once per invoice when a
/// listening session starts (<c>LightningInstanceListener.PollAllListenedInvoices</c>); its one-minute
/// <c>_ListenPoller</c> timer only calls <c>CheckConnections()</c>, which expires stale entries and restarts
/// a <em>dead</em> session — it polls no invoices. Since <c>WaitInvoice</c> here awaits a channel and never
/// faults, the session never dies and never re-polls. Without this task, a dropped completion event means an
/// invoice that expires unpaid while the sats sit in the merchant's wallet.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>A quiet store would pay for its own scan, so a pass shares one across an invoice page.</b> Each
/// invoice with no recorded SDK payment id costs up to ten pages of payment history per pass, every
/// minute, and a store with five waiting invoices and no incoming traffic pays that five times over to
/// find nothing. So the pass runs one scan for the whole page — anchored to its oldest unpaid invoice and
/// indexed by payment hash — and settles records straight out of the index. What the index does not name
/// counts as unpaid <em>only</em> when the scan saw a short page: ten full pages prove only that more
/// history was there to read, not that the payment is absent, so on a capped or failed sweep every miss
/// falls back to the per-invoice scan that ran before the batching existed. Coverage is unchanged; only
/// the cost is shared.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Settling is not the same as crediting, and both happen here.</b> Notifying BTCPay's listener only works
/// while that listener is watching the BOLT11 in question, and it watches only each invoice's <em>current</em>
/// payment prompt — so a superseded BOLT11 paid after a restart settles here and reaches no BTCPay invoice.
/// Every settlement is therefore also routed to the invoice its BOLT11 was minted for, through
/// <see cref="SparkInvoiceCreditor"/>, and retried by <see cref="CreditStoreAsync"/> until it lands. The two
/// paths cannot double-credit: they collide on BTCPay's own payments primary key.
