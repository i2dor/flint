/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every action resolves its store through <see cref="ResolveStore"/> and never trusts a bound
/// parameter.</b> This is not defensive style, it is the fix for a real cross-store hole. BTCPay's
/// authorisation handler reads the store id out of <em>route</em> data, while ASP.NET Core model binding
/// prefers <em>form</em> values over route values — so an action that acted on a bound
/// <c>string storeId</c> could be authorised against the caller's own store and then act on somebody
/// else's, simply by posting <c>storeId=victim</c> in the body. The consequence was another store's
/// Lightning invoices minting into the attacker's wallet. Route binding is pinned with
/// <see cref="FromRouteAttribute"/> <em>and</em> the value is checked against the store BTCPay actually
/// authorised, because either alone would be enough and neither is expensive.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The seed is never rendered back from storage.</b> A freshly generated seed passes through core's
/// recovery-seed screen once, on the way in. There is no reveal-seed action, deliberately: the merchant's own
/// backup is the recovery path, and the settings blob is encrypted with keys that live in the BTCPay data
/// directory.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The sweep pages are setup page 2. They are reached from the status page and from the setup page through the
/// <c>spark-status-post-body</c> and <c>spark-setup-post-body</c> extension points, and
/// <see cref="SparkStoreProvisioner"/> carries a store's sweep settings across a seed change.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Nothing here decides whether a sweep is safe.</b> The sweep actions are a thin shell over
/// <see cref="SparkSweepEngine"/>: the fee ceiling, the economic floor, the dust floor and the destination rules
/// are all enforced inside the engine, against a live quote, on both the automatic and the manual path. The form
/// validation on the settings page is a courtesy to the merchant, not the guard.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Nothing here decides anything the API decides differently.</b> Since the Greenfield surface arrived
/// (<see cref="GreenfieldSparkController"/>), every decision the two share lives in a service both call:
/// <see cref="SparkSeedResolver"/> for the seed sources and the hot-wallet policy gate,
/// <see cref="SparkStoreStatusReader"/> for what "status" is, <see cref="SparkSweepSettingsService"/> for what a
/// valid sweep configuration is, <see cref="SparkStoreProvisioner"/> for provisioning and removal, and the engine
/// for sweeping. What is left in this class is rendering and redirecting.
