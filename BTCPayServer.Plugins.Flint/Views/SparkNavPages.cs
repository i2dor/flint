/// One constant per <em>nav entry</em>, not per page: the tag helper also emits the value as an element id
/// (<c>menu-item-{value}</c>), so two entries sharing a constant would produce a duplicate id and light up
/// together. Pages that are reached from a section rather than from the nav — the sweep confirmation and
/// the removal page — borrow the constant of the entry they sit under, which is what keeps that entry
/// highlighted while the merchant is on them. The values are prefixed because the id lands in a document
/// shared with core and every other installed plugin.
