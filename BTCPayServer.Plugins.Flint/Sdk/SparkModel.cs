/// <c>details.Lightning.htlcDetails</c> — which is nullable. Normalising all of that once, in
/// <see cref="SparkPaymentMapper"/>, keeps every consumer honest about units and nullability.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Amounts are in <b>satoshi</b>, matching the SDK. BTCPay works in millisatoshi; convert at the

/// <param name="SdkPaymentId">
/// The SDK's opaque payment id (an SSP transfer id). The only key <c>GetPayment</c> accepts. For
/// outgoing payments this value changes from provisional to final, so never use it as a durable key
/// for a send.

/// Lower-case hex payment hash, or null when neither the HTLC details nor the BOLT11 yielded one.
/// </param>
/// <param name="AmountSats">
/// What moved to the counterparty, with <paramref name="FeeSats"/> reported separately alongside it, so a send
/// debits <c>AmountSats + FeeSats</c> in total.

/// <b>Already net of the fee under <c>FeePolicy.FeesIncluded</c></b> — the SDK does that netting itself on the
/// payment, and a 62,000 sat drain quoted at 1,710 sat comes back as amount 60,290, fees 1,710. Do not subtract
/// the fee again; a sweep message that did understated a real mainnet sweep by exactly one fee. This is the
/// opposite of <see cref="SparkOnchainQuote.AmountSats"/> on the <em>quote</em>, which is not adjusted for the
